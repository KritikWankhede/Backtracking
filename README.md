# Backtracking

 N Queens Problem and Sudoku Solver

This repository contains Java implementations of two classic backtracking algorithms: solving the N Queens problem and solving Sudoku puzzles. 

Backtracking is a powerful technique used to solve problems involving making a sequence of choices, and undoing them if they lead to a dead end.

The N Queens problem is a classic puzzle where you need to place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. The solution demonstrates the application of backtracking to find valid arrangements of queens.

The Sudoku solver in this repository uses backtracking to solve Sudoku puzzles. Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle where the goal is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
